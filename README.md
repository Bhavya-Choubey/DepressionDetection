# Depression Detection from Tweets

## Project Overview:
This project analyzes tweets to detect signs of depression using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classical machine learning models. The system classifies tweets as indicative of depressive behavior or not, providing insights into mental health trends.

## Objective:
Automatically detect depressive tendencies from social media posts.
Demonstrate practical use of NLP and ML techniques on real-world text data.

## Key Features:
Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization
Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
Classification using Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes
Evaluation via confusion matrix and classification report

## Tech Stack:
Languages: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, nltk, scikit-learn
